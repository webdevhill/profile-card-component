## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The card component itself was simple enough. Although, in the design files it occupies more of the viewport. I sized the card proportionally to the 18px specifies for the name and stats. The two SVG backgroundtook some tinkering. They look fairly close.
